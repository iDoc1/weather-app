BEFORE RUNNING PROGRAM:
Before running this app ensure that you have obtained a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. 
Website link here: https://openweathermap.org/api

Copy your API key to the API_KEY.txt document in the src/main/resources folder. Enter
key in the following format API_KEY : {past key here} . Once copied to this file the 
program should function normally.

In order to run the App you must have Apache Maven installed, or you must download the class
libraries specified in the Maven POM file. The JSON-Simple library and Unirest library are
used in this program to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data.


HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
To run this Weather App execute the WeatherAppMain class and follow the prompts to see 
current weather and 7 day forecast weather for a specific location. The location can either
be a city that you specify or your current location based on your IP address.


ADDITIONAL INFO:
I created this Weather App as an exercise to practice basic Java object oriented skills
and learn how to interact with API's to obtain various types of data.
