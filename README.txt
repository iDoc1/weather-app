In order to run the App you must have Apache Maven installed, or you must

library and Unirest library are used in this program to interact with the 
OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data.

to see current weather and 7 day forecast weather for a specific location. The 
location can eitherbe a city that you specify or your current location based on 
your IP address.


ADDITIONAL INFO:
I created this Weather App as an exercise to practice Java object oriented 
programming and learn how to interact with API's to obtain various types 
of data.
